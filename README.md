# Adaptive Traction Architecture Diagnostic Tool

## About ATA Diagnostic

The Adaptive Traction Architecture (ATA) Diagnostic tool helps SaaS startups identify growth bottlenecks across four critical pillars: Product, Revenue, People, and Systems. Created by [Minimalist Innovation](https://minimalistinnovation.com), this self-assessment tool gives founders a quick health check of their business and highlights areas needing attention.

### Who This Is For

- SaaS startups earning $1M - $10M yearly
- Founders facing growth plateaus or market shifts
- Teams considering a pivot or experiencing scaling challenges
- Startups with unpredictable revenue, high CAC, team misalignment, or system bottlenecks

## Features

- **Full-Stack Assessment**: Evaluate all four pillars of your startup's architecture
- **Visual Bottleneck Heatmap**: Identify your critical constraints at a glance
- **Actionable Insights**: Get specific recommendations based on your growth stage
- **Benchmark Comparison**: See how your startup compares to others at your stage

## Growth Stages Supported

- **Validation Seekers** ($1M - $2M): Startups proving their business model
- **Traction Builders** ($2M - $4M): Startups hitting their first growth plateau
- **Scale Preparers** ($4M - $7M): Startups struggling with growth costs
- **Growth Accelerators** ($7M - $10M): Startups entering new markets
- **Frequent Pivoters** (All Stages): Startups changing direction often

## How It Works
